# Documentation

Code needs explanation, and sometimes those who know the code well have trouble explaining it to someone just getting into it. Because of that, we welcome documentation suggestions and patches from everyone, especially if they are brand new to using Lic.

Currently, Lic has two main sources of documentation:

1. built-in `help` (including usage information and man pages)
2. [Lic documentation site](http://lic.io)

If you have a suggestion or proposed change for [lic.io](http://lic.io), please open an issue or send a pull request to the [lic-site](https://github.com/lic/lic-site) repository.

Not sure where to write documentation? In general, follow these guidelines:

* For an explanation of a specific Lic command (ex: `lic clean`): make changes to the man pages
* For longer explanations or usage guides (ex: "Using Lic with Rails"): create new documentation within the [lic-site](https://github.com/lic/lic-site) repository

If you are unsure where to begin, ping [@feministy](https://github.com/feministy) or [@indirect](https://github.com/indirect) in the Lic Slack ([get an invite here](../contributing/GETTING_HELP.md)).

## [Writing docs for man pages](WRITING.md)

If youâ€™d like to submit a patch to the man pages, you're in the right place! Details on editing and previewing changes to man pages can be found [here](WRITING.md).

## [Documentation vision](VISION.md)

Just like Lic, we have a grand plan (really, a wish list of sorts) for Lic documentation. Preview our hopes and dreams for our documentation [here](VISION.md).

## Translations

We don't currently have any translations, but please reach out to us if you would like to help get this going.

Please feel free to reach out to [@arbonap](https://github.com/arbonap) if you'd like to help localize Lic in Spanish.
